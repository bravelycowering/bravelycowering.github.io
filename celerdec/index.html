			<h1>CELERDEC</h1>
			<p>This is a game that I'm working on making. Currently there is no playable demo for it, but theres a prototype I made years ago that has similar gameplay! You can play that below. If that isn't working, you can also play it <a href="https://bravelycowering.net/celerdec-web-demo">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>How to play</h3>
			<p>Use WASD to move around, aim with the mouse, use the left mouse button to shoot and the right mouse button to dash. You are fully invincible while you are dashing, which can let you dash through enemies to get away.</p>
			<p>As you deal damage to things you will gain smileys, which will orbit you. The more you have, the more passive regeneration and higher health boost you get, though you can destroy them for points if you want. Taking damage will cause one to automatically destroy itself though, so be careful.</p>
