I'm not sure what you are looking for, but it's not here.
Do you think the page that was here ran away?
I've checked everywhere, even under the couch cushions, but theres nothing.
I did find a random string of text to put here instead though.
Maybe it's just sleeping.
The real page was the 404s we ran into along the way.
If there's something to take away from this, I have no idea what it is.
Could you describe the page to me? I might be able to find something in the lost and found.
I swear I just set it down on the table and it's gone now.
